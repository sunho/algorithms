# The reasons why I got RA

## 1. Omitted zero input exception

Since it is problem-specific, it doesn't matter a lot.

## 2. Wrong recurrence relation

The objective was to achieve the following where 2 and 5 represent the numbers of 2 and 5 as factors.

```
Min min(2, 5) ->
Min min(min(2), min(5))
```

But I set a recurrence relation that minimizes min(min(2,5)).

# The reasons why I got TL

## 1. Used cin instead of scanf

std::cin was horribly slower than I thought. Should use scanf always.
