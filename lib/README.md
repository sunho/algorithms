# Competitive Programming Library

Most of the code here was initially collected from online (cp-algorithm, atcoder) and modified in personal tatse. (code style, variation, etc)

They all have been tested at actual cp problems on atcoder, codeforces, and baekjoon.

## List 

### Number theory / arithematics

* modular integer
* saturated integer
* prime factorization
* prime sieves
* extended gcd
* totient function
* chinese remainder theorem
* bionmial coefficient
* pollard rho big prime factorizaton
* matrix
* binary exponetitaion

### Range query

* generic recursive segment tree
* fast iterative segment tree
* fenwick tree with lower_bound
* Mo's algorithm

### Graph

* disjoint set union
* dinic max flow
* min cost max flow
* shortest path faster algorithm

### String

* prefix function caclulation (can be transformed to KMP)
* polynomial string hash
* binary trie
* trie

### Utils

* hash table with codeforces hack prevention
* __int128 to string that can be outputed to cout
* ilog2 with using builtin
